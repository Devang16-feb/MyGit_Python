A boy in the tribe promises that he will one day find out the man's identity.

Years later at 2023 in Mumbai, Azad, a police officer who is the jailer of Belamvada women's prison, hijacks a Mumbai Metro train with a group of six inmates: Lakshmi, Eeram, Iskra, Kalki, Helana, and Janvi, holding the passengers hostage. When a police officer captures one of the group, Azad ties him up but doesn't hurt him. Azad also shoots a female hostage. Azad then narrates about the suicide of Kalki's father, a poor farmer, who was harassed by the bank over his inability to pay loans to the hostages. Azad negotiates with Force One officer Narmada Rai to ask the Agriculture Minister to send â‚¹40,000 crores in exchange for the hostages' lives. Kalee Gaikwad, a global arms dealer, learns that his daughter Alia is one of the captives and agrees to fund the deal. Azad plans to donate the money toward the loan waiver of 7,00,000 impoverished farmers in the country. It is also revealed that the hostage shot was secretly one of hijackers and is not wounded at all. Azad and his gang transfer the funds into the farmers' bank accounts and escape. Through Alia, Azad reveals his name as Vikram Rathore to Kalee.
